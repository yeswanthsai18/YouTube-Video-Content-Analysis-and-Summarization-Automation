# YouTube-Video-Content-Analysis-and-Summarization-Automation
A software program will take the YouTube video link of the userâ€™s choice as  input. And there are two types of content we are going to extract as; one is the  summarized text content from the video using Natural Language Processing, and  the second form of content is details of the YouTube video like; the name of the  video, views count, the category under which the video had shared, etc. using web  scraping process. This allows the user to save his time and improve efficiency in  information extraction from an unstructured data source.
